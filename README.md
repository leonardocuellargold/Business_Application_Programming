### CSV to ARFF File Converter
**Description**: This program processes CSV files from a specified directory, converts them into ARFF files, and provides functionality to retrieve specific cell values from these files.

**Features**:
- Recursive file searching and listing.
- Conversion of CSV files to ARFF format.
- Retrieving and displaying specific cell values from files.

**Key Concepts**:
- Recursive directory searching.
- String manipulation and file path handling.
- User input and data retrieval.
